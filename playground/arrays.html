    /*
    An array is a list-like object used to store a collection of multiple items in a single
    variable.

    Array literal: `const newArray = ['item1', 'item2']`

    Arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at
    index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property
    minus 1.

    Elements are stored in the order in which they are inserted, and this order is preserved
    when accessing or iterating over the array.

    Arrays are dynamic in size - items can be added or removed

    Flexible data types - Arrays can hold values of different types (numbers, strings,
    objects, functions, etc.), and JavaScript arrays do not require that all elements have
    the same type.

    Some array methods:
      `push()` / `pop()`: Add/remove elements at the end.

      `unshift()` / `shift()`: Add/remove elements at the start.

      `map()`: Create a new array by applying a function to each element.

      `filter()`: Create a new array with only elements that pass a test.

      `forEach()`: Execute a function on each element.

      `reduce()`: Accumulate values into a single result.
