    // An object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data and more complex entities.

    /*
    Properties and Values:
      Objects are collections of properties, where each property is an association between a key (also known as a property name) and a value.

      Property names can be strings or symbols, and values can be any data type, including other objects and functions.

      Note: the order of the properties does not matter (see 'NOTE: The order of
      properties' below)

      Syntax:
      Object Literal Syntax = `const objName = {};`
      `new Object()` Syntax =  `const objName = new Object({});`

    /*
    NOTE: The order of properties in an object is generally consistent but follows 
    specific rules. The properties of an object are enumerated in the following 
    order:

      1. Integer Keys: Properties with keys that are non-negative integers (e.g., 0,
      1, 2, etc.) are enumerated first, in ascending numerical order.

      2. String Keys: Properties with keys that are strings (but not valid
      non-negative integers) are enumerated next, in the order in which they were
      added to the object.

      3. Symbol Keys: Properties with keys that are symbols are enumerated last, in
      the order in which they were added to the object.
